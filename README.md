### Project Overview
This project is designed for learning purposes, and the initial design inspiration was taken from the following mentor challenge:

[Frontend Mentor - Intro Section with Dropdown Navigation](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5?tab=downloads)

## Objective:
The core idea of the project was to create a simple dropdown component, but I used this as a base to implement several additional features, including:

- Dark Mode functionality
- Responsive Design
- While the project is still in progress, the goal is to continuously add new features to enhance its functionality.

## Features in Development:
- To-Do List (currently under construction)
- Multi-language support (language switcher)
- Calendar
- Login and Registration (including reusable components for authentication forms)
- Planning tools
- And additional features as they arise

## Recent Updates:
- Implemented login and registration screens
- Created reusable authentication components for input fields and social login buttons
- Added password confirmation field for registration
- Improved UI consistency across authentication screens

## Preliminary Result:
Here's a preview of the current layout:
